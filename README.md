## 🤔 What Is This?

**You think it. FinResearchClaw researches it.**

Drop a finance, accounting, or investment research topic — get back a paper draft, experiment plans, sandbox code, charts, and evidence-oriented writeups tuned for event studies, factor research, accounting regressions, forecast-error work, and related workflows. It still inherits the broader ResearchClaw engine underneath, but the opinionated surface area is now finance-first.

<table>
<tr><td>📄</td><td><code>paper_draft.md</code></td><td>Full academic paper (Introduction, Related Work, Method, Experiments, Results, Conclusion)</td></tr>
<tr><td>📐</td><td><code>paper.tex</code></td><td>Conference-ready LaTeX (NeurIPS / ICLR / ICML templates)</td></tr>
<tr><td>📚</td><td><code>references.bib</code></td><td>Real BibTeX references from OpenAlex, Semantic Scholar and arXiv — auto-pruned to match inline citations</td></tr>
<tr><td>🔍</td><td><code>verification_report.json</code></td><td>4-layer citation integrity + relevance verification (arXiv, CrossRef, DataCite, LLM)</td></tr>
<tr><td>🧪</td><td><code>experiment runs/</code></td><td>Generated code + sandbox results + structured JSON metrics</td></tr>
<tr><td>📊</td><td><code>charts/</code></td><td>Auto-generated condition comparison charts with error bars and confidence intervals</td></tr>
<tr><td>📝</td><td><code>reviews.md</code></td><td>Multi-agent peer review with methodology-evidence consistency checks</td></tr>
<tr><td>🧬</td><td><code>evolution/</code></td><td>Self-learning lessons extracted from each run</td></tr>
<tr><td>📦</td><td><code>deliverables/</code></td><td>All final outputs in one folder — compile-ready for Overleaf</td></tr>
</table>

The pipeline runs **end-to-end without human intervention**. When experiments fail, it self-heals. When hypotheses don't hold, it pivots. When citations are fake, it kills them.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone & install
git clone https://github.com/ChipmunkRPA/FinResearchClaw.git
cd FinResearchClaw
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .

# 2. Setup (interactive — installs OpenCode beast mode, checks Docker/LaTeX)
researchclaw setup

# 3. Configure
researchclaw init          # Interactive: choose LLM provider, creates config.arc.yaml
# Or manually: cp config.researchclaw.example.yaml config.arc.yaml

# 4. Run
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
researchclaw run --config config.arc.yaml --topic "Your research idea" --auto-approve
```

Output → `artifacts/rc-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-<hash>/deliverables/` — compile-ready LaTeX, BibTeX, experiment code, charts.

<details>
<summary>📝 Minimum required config</summary>

```yaml
project:
  name: "my-research"

research:
  topic: "Your research topic here"

llm:
  base_url: "https://api.openai.com/v1"
  api_key_env: "OPENAI_API_KEY"
  primary_model: "gpt-4o"
  fallback_models: ["gpt-4o-mini"]

experiment:
  mode: "sandbox"
  sandbox:
    python_path: ".venv/bin/python"
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>💹 Finance / accounting / investment example</summary>

```yaml
project:
  name: "earnings-event-study"

research:
  topic: "Event study of abnormal returns around earnings announcements"
  domains: ["finance", "accounting"]

experiment:
  mode: "sandbox"
  metric_key: "primary_metric"
  metric_direction: "maximize"
```

This topic now auto-detects the `finance_accounting_investment` domain and nudges the pipeline toward:
- benchmark factor models first
- event-window and robustness checks
- look-ahead / survivorship / leakage warnings
- finance-style outputs like alpha, CAR/BHAR, forecast error, and regression tables

## 🧠 What Makes It Different

| Capability | How It Works |
|-----------|-------------|
| **🔄 PIVOT / REFINE Loop** | Stage 15 autonomously decides: PROCEED, REFINE (tweak params), or PIVOT (new direction). Artifacts auto-versioned. |
| **🤖 Multi-Agent Debate** | Hypothesis generation, result analysis, and peer review each use structured multi-perspective debate. |
| **🧬 Self-Learning** | Lessons extracted per run (decision rationale, runtime warnings, metric anomalies) with 30-day time-decay. Future runs learn from past mistakes. |
| **📚 Knowledge Base** | Every run builds structured KB across 6 categories (decisions, experiments, findings, literature, questions, reviews). |
| **🛡️ Sentinel Watchdog** | Background quality monitor: NaN/Inf detection, paper-evidence consistency, citation relevance scoring, anti-fabrication guard. |
| **💹 Finance / Accounting Research** | Detects finance-style topics and steers generation toward benchmark factor models, event studies, accounting regressions, forecast-error analysis, and bias checks. |

## 🦞 OpenClaw Integration

<table>
<tr>

**FinResearchClaw is an [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)-compatible service.** Install it in OpenClaw and launch finance-oriented autonomous research with a single message — or use it standalone via CLI, Claude Code, or any AI coding assistant.

</tr>
</table>

### 🚀 Use with OpenClaw (Recommended)

If you already use [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) as your AI assistant:

```
1️⃣  Share the GitHub repo URL with OpenClaw
2️⃣  OpenClaw auto-reads RESEARCHCLAW_AGENTS.md → understands the pipeline
3️⃣  Say: "Research [your topic]"
4️⃣  Done — OpenClaw clones, installs, configures, runs, and returns results
```

**That's it.** OpenClaw handles `git clone`, `pip install`, config setup, and pipeline execution automatically. You just chat.

<details>
<summary>💡 What happens under the hood</summary>

1. OpenClaw reads `RESEARCHCLAW_AGENTS.md` → learns the research orchestrator role
2. OpenClaw reads `README.md` → understands installation and pipeline structure
3. OpenClaw copies `config.researchclaw.example.yaml` → `config.yaml`
4. Asks for your LLM API key (or uses your environment variable)
5. Runs `pip install -e .` + `researchclaw run --topic "..." --auto-approve`
6. Returns the paper, LaTeX, experiments, and citations

</details>

### 🔌 OpenClaw Bridge (Advanced)

For deeper integration, FinResearchClaw includes a **bridge adapter system** with 6 optional capabilities:

```yaml
# config.arc.yaml
openclaw_bridge:
  use_cron: true              # ⏰ Scheduled research runs
  use_message: true           # 💬 Progress notifications (Discord/Slack/Telegram)
  use_memory: true            # 🧠 Cross-session knowledge persistence
  use_sessions_spawn: true    # 🔀 Spawn parallel sub-sessions for concurrent stages
  use_web_fetch: true         # 🌐 Live web search during literature review
  use_browser: false          # 🖥️ Browser-based paper collection
```

Each flag activates a typed adapter protocol. When OpenClaw provides these capabilities, the adapters consume them without code changes. See [`docs/integration-guide.md`](docs/integration-guide.md) for full details.

### ACP (Agent Client Protocol)

FinResearchClaw can use **any ACP-compatible coding agent** as its LLM backend — no API keys required. The agent communicates via [acpx](https://github.com/openclaw/acpx), maintaining a single persistent session across all 23 pipeline stages.

| Agent | Command | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Claude Code | `claude` | Anthropic |
| Codex CLI | `codex` | OpenAI |
| Copilot CLI | `gh` | GitHub |
| Gemini CLI | `gemini` | Google |
| OpenCode | `opencode` | SST |
| Kimi CLI | `kimi` | Moonshot |

```yaml
# config.yaml — ACP example
llm:
  provider: "acp"
  acp:
    agent: "claude"   # Any ACP-compatible agent CLI command
    cwd: "."          # Working directory for the agent
  # No base_url or api_key needed — the agent handles its own auth.
```

```bash
# Just run — the agent uses its own credentials
researchclaw run --config config.yaml --topic "Your research idea" --auto-approve
```

### 🛠️ Other Ways to Run

| Method | How |
|--------|-----|
| **Standalone CLI** | `researchclaw setup` → `researchclaw init` → `researchclaw run --topic "..." --auto-approve` |
| **Python API** | `from researchclaw.pipeline import Runner; Runner(config).run()` |
| **Claude Code** | Reads `RESEARCHCLAW_CLAUDE.md` — just say *"Run research on [topic]"* |
| **Copilot CLI** | `researchclaw run --topic "..."` with `llm.acp.agent: "gh"` |
| **OpenCode** | Reads `.claude/skills/` — same natural language interface |
| **Any AI CLI** | Provide `RESEARCHCLAW_AGENTS.md` as context → agent auto-bootstraps |

## 🔬 Pipeline: 23 Stages, 8 Phases

```
Phase A: Research Scoping          Phase E: Experiment Execution
  1. TOPIC_INIT                      12. EXPERIMENT_RUN
  2. PROBLEM_DECOMPOSE               13. ITERATIVE_REFINE  ← self-healing

Phase B: Literature Discovery      Phase F: Analysis & Decision
  3. SEARCH_STRATEGY                 14. RESULT_ANALYSIS    ← multi-agent
  4. LITERATURE_COLLECT  ← real API  15. RESEARCH_DECISION  ← PIVOT/REFINE
  5. LITERATURE_SCREEN   [gate]
  6. KNOWLEDGE_EXTRACT               Phase G: Paper Writing
                                     16. PAPER_OUTLINE
Phase C: Knowledge Synthesis         17. PAPER_DRAFT
  7. SYNTHESIS                       18. PEER_REVIEW        ← evidence check
  8. HYPOTHESIS_GEN    ← debate      19. PAPER_REVISION

Phase D: Experiment Design         Phase H: Finalization
  9. EXPERIMENT_DESIGN   [gate]      20. QUALITY_GATE      [gate]
 10. CODE_GENERATION                 21. KNOWLEDGE_ARCHIVE
 11. RESOURCE_PLANNING               22. EXPORT_PUBLISH     ← LaTeX
                                     23. CITATION_VERIFY    ← relevance check
```

> **Gate stages** (5, 9, 20) pause for human approval or auto-approve with `--auto-approve`. On rejection, the pipeline rolls back.

> **Decision loops**: Stage 15 can trigger REFINE (→ Stage 13) or PIVOT (→ Stage 8), with automatic artifact versioning.

<details>
<summary>📋 What Each Phase Does</summary>

| Phase | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|
| **A: Scoping** | LLM decomposes the topic into a structured problem tree with research questions |
| **A+: Hardware** | Auto-detects GPU (NVIDIA CUDA / Apple MPS / CPU-only), warns if local hardware is limited, adapts code generation accordingly |
| **B: Literature** | Multi-source search (OpenAlex → Semantic Scholar → arXiv) for real papers, screens by relevance, extracts knowledge cards |
| **C: Synthesis** | Clusters findings, identifies research gaps, generates testable hypotheses via multi-agent debate |
| **D: Design** | Designs experiment plan, generates hardware-aware runnable Python (GPU tier → package selection), estimates resource needs |
| **E: Execution** | Runs experiments in sandbox, detects NaN/Inf and runtime bugs, self-heals code via targeted LLM repair |
| **F: Analysis** | Multi-agent analysis of results; autonomous PROCEED / REFINE / PIVOT decision with rationale |
| **G: Writing** | Outlines → section-by-section drafting (5,000-6,500 words) → peer reviews (with methodology-evidence consistency) → revises with length guard |
| **H: Finalization** | Quality gate, knowledge archival, LaTeX export with conference template, citation integrity + relevance verification |

## 🧠 MetaClaw Integration

**FinResearchClaw + [MetaClaw](https://github.com/aiming-lab/MetaClaw) = A finance-focused pipeline that learns from every run.**

MetaClaw adds **cross-run knowledge transfer** to FinResearchClaw. When enabled, the pipeline automatically captures lessons from failures and warnings, converts them into reusable skills, and injects those skills into all 23 pipeline stages on subsequent runs — so the same mistakes are never repeated.

### How It Works

```
Run N executes → failures/warnings captured as Lessons
                      ↓
          MetaClaw Lesson → Skill conversion
                      ↓
          arc-* Skill files stored in ~/.metaclaw/skills/
                      ↓
Run N+1 → build_overlay() injects skills into every LLM prompt
                      ↓
          LLM avoids known pitfalls → higher quality, fewer retries
```

### Quick Setup

```bash
# 1. Install MetaClaw (if not already)
pip install metaclaw

# 2. Enable in your config
```

```yaml
# config.arc.yaml
metaclaw_bridge:
  enabled: true
  proxy_url: "http://localhost:30000"        # MetaClaw proxy (optional)
  skills_dir: "~/.metaclaw/skills"          # Where skills are stored
  fallback_url: "https://api.openai.com/v1" # Direct LLM fallback
  fallback_api_key: ""                      # API key for fallback URL
  lesson_to_skill:
    enabled: true
    min_severity: "warning"                 # Convert warnings + errors
    max_skills_per_run: 3
```

```bash
# 3. Run as usual — MetaClaw works transparently
researchclaw run --config config.arc.yaml --topic "Your idea" --auto-approve
```

After each run, check `~/.metaclaw/skills/arc-*/SKILL.md` to see the skills your pipeline has learned.

### Experiment Results

In controlled A/B experiments (same topic, same LLM, same configuration):

| Metric | Baseline | With MetaClaw | Improvement |
|--------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Stage retry rate | 10.5% | 7.9% | **-24.8%** |
| Refine cycle count | 2.0 | 1.2 | **-40.0%** |
| Pipeline stage completion | 18/19 | 19/19 | **+5.3%** |
| Overall robustness score (composite) | 0.714 | 0.845 | **+18.3%** |

> Composite robustness score is a weighted average of stage completion rate (40%), retry reduction (30%), and refine cycle efficiency (30%).

### Backward Compatibility

- **Default: OFF.** If `metaclaw_bridge` is absent or `enabled: false`, the pipeline behaves exactly as before.
- **No new dependencies.** MetaClaw is optional — the core pipeline works without it.
- **All 1,634 existing tests pass** with the integration code present.
